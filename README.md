# Investigation-of-socio-economic-factors-influencing-cancer-mortality-in-the-united-states
This project was conducted during my postgraduate degree to develop a robust multiple linear regression model for predicting county-level cancer-related death rates. By utilizing demographic data and the incidence rate of cancer for each county, various regression models were explored to identify the most suitable one.
# Workflow Process
1. Utilized a cancer CSV dataset containing data from over 3000 US counties. 
2. Performed exploratory data analysis on the dataset.
3. Utilized a correlation matrix to examine the relationship between independent variables.
4. Removed outliers to improve prediction accuracy.
5. Verified the data against the predictions of the linear regression model.
6. Built the models using a stepwise regression approach.
7. Identified the second model as the most suitable one, which included an estimation of each predictor variable's coefficient, statistical tests of significance, measures of model fit, and diagnostic plots to evaluate the model's performance and underlying assumptions.
# Tools Used
